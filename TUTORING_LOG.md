# Tutoring Log - C Memory Inspector Project

## Purpose
Track learning sessions, concepts covered, and user progress throughout our tutoring journey.

## Session Structure
Each session entry includes:
- Timestamp and duration
- Topics covered with depth level
- User questions and understanding indicators  
- Key insights and "aha" moments
- Next session preparation notes

## Session 1 - Project Setup and Baseline Assessment
**Date**: 2026-01-20  
**Duration**: [In Progress]  
**Topics Covered**:
- Project structure analysis
- Tutor personality integration planning
- Documentation system setup

**Key Insights**:
- Project has excellent progressive complexity (Logger → Vector → Memory Inspector)
- Rich teaching opportunities in memory management and C patterns
- User prefers structured approach with context retention

**User Understanding Indicators**:
- Asked thoughtful questions about context retention
- Interested in long-term learning strategy
- Prefers documentation and assessment first
- **CRITICAL INSIGHT**: User is original author of all code
- Returning to project after some time away
- Wants to refresh and deepen understanding of own work
- Goal-oriented: wants to reach reverse engineering level
- Prefers interactive learning style

**Next Session Preparation**:
- Begin with Logger module fundamentals (memory allocation patterns)
- Focus on "why" behind code decisions to build reverse engineering intuition
- Use interactive approach - explore code together, then discuss concepts
- Connect each concept to how programs work internally
- **REMEMBER**: Create demos in "demos/" directory, not current working directory
- **REMEMBER**: Put explanations/notes in "notes/" directory
- **PRIORITY**: Continue file-based memory inspector registry design when user returns
