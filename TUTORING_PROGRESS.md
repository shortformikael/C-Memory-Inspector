## Assessment Results

### Baseline Knowledge (Session 1)
**Assessment Date**: 2026-01-20

**Overall Level**: Original author of the codebase returning to continue learning

**Current Experience**:
- **Code Author**: You wrote all the existing code
- **Memory Management**: Implemented patterns in logger and memory inspector
- **Function Pointers**: Created function pointer swapping in memory inspector  
- **C Macros & Preprocessor**: Built macro interception system
- **Modular C Programming**: Designed the entire modular structure

**Learning Style**: Interactive - prefers rediscovering own work with guided exploration

**Primary Goal**: Deep understanding of how programs work, eventually leading to reverse engineering capabilities

**Key Insight**: This is a continuation journey - refreshing and deepening concepts you already implemented, not learning from scratch.

### Progress Milestones
*This section will track significant learning achievements*

## Learning Style Preferences
- **Preferred Approach**: Interactive learning with mix of theory and hands-on
- **Question Style**: Responsive to guided exploration and discovery
